It is known that when two bodies with curved surfaces come into contact under a force, point or line contact between these bodies changes to area contact and 3 dimensional stresses are developed. It is important to understand contact stresses when calculating the strength of bearings, gears, and worm drives, ball and cylindrical rollers, and cam mechanisms. Surface failures are typically characterized by cracks, pits, or flaking.

The contact stress calculator has been designed to calculate contact pressure and contact stress for three types of contact(Sphere on Plane, Sphere on Sphere, and Cylinder on Cylinder). And the outputs are: Maximum Hertzian contact pressure[Pmax], Max shear stress[taumax], Depth of max shear stress [zm], and Circular contact area diameter [a]

Note: The programming language is Python.
